## 🏥 Tumor Classes

The model classifies MRI scans into the following categories:

* **Glioma**
* **Meningioma**
* **Pituitary Tumor**
* **No Tumor**

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This project uses an **ensemble learning approach** combining:

* Custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
* **MobileNetV2** (Transfer Learning)

### Why this approach?

* CNN captures spatial features
* MobileNetV2 improves generalization
* Ensemble improves overall accuracy (~95%)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Streamlit
* NumPy
* Plotly
* PIL

## 🖼️ Image Preprocessing

Image preprocessing ensures consistency and improves model performance.

### Steps:

1. Convert image to RGB
2. Resize to **224 × 224**
3. Normalize pixel values (0–1)
4. Expand dimensions

```python
img = image.convert('RGB')
img = img.resize((224, 224))
img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
```
